# Amazon and KSRTC Automation Project

## Overview
This project automates tasks on the Amazon and KSRTC websites using Selenium and Java. Due to time constraints, Task 3, initially intended for Python, was also implemented in Java with the help of AI tools.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Amazon Automation
- **Scenario 1**: Search for "car accessories," select the first item, add it to the cart, and verify its presence in the cart.
- **Scenario 2**: Access Today's Deals, filter for "Audible Books & Originals" Because I did not find the "Headphones"," select items with "10% off or more," navigate to the fourth page, and add any item to the cart.

### Task 2: KSRTC Automation
- Navigate to KSRTC, select the route from "CHIKKAMAGALURU" to "BENGALURU," choose the arrival date, search for buses, select a seat, input boarding and dropping points, fill in passenger details, and complete the payment fields without submitting.

### Task 3: Data Processing
- Intended to process a CSV file in Python but implemented in Java due to time constraints. Tasks included removing duplicates, converting salaries, and generating statistics.

## Tools Used
- **Selenium** for web automation.
- **Java** for scripting.
- **TestNG** for organizing tests.
- **Maven** for project management.
- **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for better maintainability and reusability.
- **GitHub** for version control.

## Conclusion
Successfully automated tasks on Amazon and KSRTC. Future work includes completing the data processing task in Python.
